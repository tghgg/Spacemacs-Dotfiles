# Spacemacs Dotfile
It's what it says on the tin.

My setup is tailored for journaling and maybe C# programming for Unity.

Notable stuff in here:
* Org-mode
* Org-download
  * To easily drag and drop images into Spacemacs
* Atom Dark as the default theme
* Magit
* Use word wrapping and truncate lines by default
* Autosave
